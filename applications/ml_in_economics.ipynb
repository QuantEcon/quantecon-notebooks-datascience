    "$$\n",
    "y = \\theta d + f(x) + \\epsilon\n",

    "$ x $ .\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical applied econometric approach for this model would\n",
    "be to choose some transform of $ x $, say $ X = T(x) $, where $ X $\n",
    "could be some subset of $ x $ , perhaps along with interactions, powers, and\n",
    "so on. Then, we estimate a linear regression,\n",
