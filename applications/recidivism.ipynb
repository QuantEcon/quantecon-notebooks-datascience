    "Recidivism is the tendency for an individual who has previously committed a crime to commit another crime\n",

    "\n",
    "One key input to a judge’s sentencing decision is how likely a given convict is to re-offend, or recidivate\n",

    "In an effort to assist the legal system with sentencing guidelines, data scientists have attempted\n",
    "to predict an individual’s risk of recidivism from known observables\n",
