    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The job of an economist (or data scientist) goes beyond simply learning new things using data and\n",
    "theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of learning these new things is to be able to communicate these ideas to others\n",
    "whether the medium is an academic paper or a business meeting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most effective mediums to do this communication is visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Well done visualizations help your audience remember your message\n",
    "\n",
    "They accomplish this through at least two main channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pyschology researchers refer to the fact that pictures/images are more likely to be remembered than\n",
    "  words as [*picture superiority*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_superiority_effect). There\n",
    "  is some discrepancy about the size of this effect and what causes, but there is strong agreement that\n",
    "  the effect exists. As an example about how large these effects might be, we describe the outcomes\n",
    "  from a paper by Defeyter, Russo, and McPartlin (2009). In this paper, the authors found that\n",
    "  after participants had studied some set of pictures and words for approximately 500 ms each\n",
    "  that the participants were able to identify pictures they had previously studied with 75-85%\n",
    "  accuracy and words with only a 55-65% accuracy.  \n",
    "1. Data visualizations help people walk through the same logic you went through to build the chart\n",
    "  which allows them to reason through the argument and makes your claim more convincing  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will discuss the process for creating a data visualization, ways to best ensure\n",
    "that your message is successfully communicated, and some general design guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way you will be introduced to many features of `matplotlib` that were not discussed in the\n",
    "introductory lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We won’t discuss most of these features, but encourage you to read more in the\n",

    "## Steps to creating effective charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin discussions of specific recommendations, we think it is helpful to agree on\n",
    "the goal of a data visualization and a process that can be used to accomplish the goal\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, the purpose of a visualization is to facilitate the communication\n",
    "of a message or idea\n",
    "\n",
    "We have found the following steps to be useful for achieving this goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the message  \n",
    "1. Describe your visualization  \n",
    "1. Create a draft of the visualization (and verify your data!)  \n",
    "1. Fine tune the visualization details  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After discussing the role research plays in data visualization, we will use an example to provide\n",
    "deeper context for the remaining steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 0: Research**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed, it’s important to note that prior to reaching this process, you will have spent\n",
    "a significant amount of time exploring the data and thinking about your overall message\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, during the research step you will almost certainly produce visualizations to help you\n",
    "understand the data you are working with\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations can highlight outliers or unlikely combinations of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, NYC publishes data on taxi pickups and dropoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "One might expect tips to be somewhat independent of whether someone pays cash or credit, but\n",
    "the 75th percentile tip for those who pay in cash is 0!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it’s unlikely that people who pay in cash choose not to tip, one likely explanation\n",
    "is that it is a reporting issue\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps and guidelines that follow may be helpful in the research process, but it’s not practical\n",
    "to get each of your exploratory visualizations to a point where you would be able to publish them,\n",
    "so some of these recommendations will be specific to what should happen to create a visualization\n",
    "that you will use to tell your story after you understand what it is"
