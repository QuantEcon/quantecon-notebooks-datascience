    "    values to some date that precedes the\n",

    "    you can identify the customers who don’t have a `\"First-Time\"`\n",
    "    entry by checking the new column for missing data.  \n",
    "1. You need to group by three things.  \n",
    "1. You can apply one of the built-in aggregation functions to the GroupBy.  \n",
